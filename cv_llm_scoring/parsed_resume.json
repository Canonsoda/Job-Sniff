Investigating the impact of facial alignment on the accuracy of ASD diagnosis using deep learning models trained on facial image datasets. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art CNN architectures such as ResNet50, MobileNet, and Xception to evaluate performance changes due to alignment techniques. Experimenting with various face detection and preprocessing pipelines to optimize diagnostic accuracy and model generalization."
